# Capsule Network with Tensorflow

This is an implementation of CapsNet for mnist based on the [Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829) paper by Sara Sabour, Nicholas Frosst, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. I used tensorflow and mnist data downloaded from Yann LeCun [website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
